The data shows a mix of squirrel-tivities. But most of all, squirrels spend a tree-mendous amount of time on and around trees. For this graph, only observations with specific location details are included. However, there are 254 mentions of tree related shenanagins in the data set! Let’s now get to the nuts and bolts of who they spend their time with.\n\n\nCode\nSquirrel3 &lt;- SquirrelCensus |&gt;\n  #Sometimes the same dog in mentioned twice in interaction\n  mutate(num_dogs = str_count(tolower(`Other Interactions`), \"(?&lt;!dog)dog\"),\n         Date = as.character(Date),\n         Day = str_sub(Date, 3, 4)) |&gt;\n  group_by(Day)\n\nggplot(Squirrel3, aes(x = Day, y = num_dogs)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"springgreen4\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Daily Encounters of Squirrels and Dogs\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Count\",\n  ) +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nchase_count &lt;- sum(str_count(tolower(SquirrelCensus), \"nut|acorn\"), na.rm = TRUE)\n\n\nDogs! These poor squirrels spend their time in Central Park running from dogs! Data is taken over the month of January 2018, but not every day is captured, creating this funky x-axis. And, to make matters worse only observations 43 mention food!\nThanks for tagging along on this journey to understand the busy social lives of our furry neighbors!
